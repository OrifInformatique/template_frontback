# React template
Template to start developing a new React frontend using Tailwind, built with Webpack.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the project as explained in the [root's README](https://github.com/OrifInformatique/template_frontback/blob/master/backend/README.md).
2. Execute `npm install`.
3. Copy-paste the `.env-template` file and rename it `.env`.
4. Edit the `APP_ROOT` variable with the path to the project root. You can also edit the port if needed.

For example, if your project is located in `/my-projects/my-app/frontend` :
```env
APP_ROOT=/my-projects/my-app/frontend
```

5. Execute `npm run serve`.
6. This page will open in your browser : [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

_Here, `4000` is the port specified in the `.env` file. If you changed it, also change it in the URL._

# You're done !

You can start coding in the `/src` folder !
